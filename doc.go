mvshaker swaps randomly your files.

It was created to remember Warsaw's Second Law: "Never change anything after
3pm on a Friday."
See http://barry.warsaw.us/software/laws.html for more details.

Directories are silently ignored and files can be excluded using --exclude
flag.

For example:

	# mvshaker /bin/* --exclude bash

--exclude flag has a compact vesion (-e) useful when you want exclude multiple
files:

	# mvshaker /bin/* -e bash -e ls
